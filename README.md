ðŸ“‘ Trade Idea Template: Macro Fixed Income
1. Trade Summary
Instrument / Expression: [e.g., US 2s5s10s Treasury butterfly]
Direction: [Long belly / short wings, or vice versa]
Tenor / Horizon: [1â€“3 months, tactical; 6â€“12 months, structural]
2. Rationale
Macro backdrop: Explain why this part of the curve is mispriced (policy stance, growth/inflation mix, supply/demand).
Relative value logic: Why this structure (butterfly) versus outright steepener/flatteners?
Historical context: Where is the fly versus historical ranges/z-scores?
3. Catalysts
Event-driven: Upcoming Fed meetings, CPI prints, Treasury refunding, macro data.
Structural: Issuance patterns (e.g. belly-heavy supply), QT dynamics, foreign demand.
Market technicals: Positioning, dealer balance sheet, convexity hedging.
4. Cyclical Regime / Scenario Analysis
Base case: Path for growth, inflation, policy â†’ expected fly behavior.
Alternative cases: Upside/downside risks (e.g., Fed cuts sooner vs later).
Cross-market consistency: Check whether Eurodollar/SOFR futures, swap spreads, or global curves corroborate.
5. Carry & Roll Dynamics
Carry profile: Daily/monthly PnL if curve does not move.
Roll-down effects: How does the fly evolve as bonds roll down the curve?
Net PnL drift: Positive/negative carry and implications for holding horizon.
6. Valuation Metrics
Historical z-score / percentile of fly.
Regression vs fundamentals (e.g., Fed funds pricing, inflation swaps).
Cross-market comps: US vs EUR/GBP fly levels.
7. Risk Management
Stop-loss: Level where thesis invalidated (e.g., fly moves 1.5Ïƒ against).
Take-profit: Target normalization (e.g., fly back to median).
Sizing: Risk budget, VaR, and liquidity considerations.
8. Implementation & Practicalities
Instrument choice: Futures vs swaps vs cash Treasuries.
Liquidity: Depth in TY/ FV/ TU contracts, OIS vs Treasury risk.
Operational: Margin, funding, cross-currency impact if relevant.
9. Monitoring & Triggers to Reassess
Data to watch: CPI, NFP, ISM, Fed speeches.
Market signals: Repo specials, auction tails, forward OIS pricing.
Time horizon: At what point do you cut if nothing plays out?

ðŸ“‘ Trade Pitch: US 2s5s10s Butterfly
1. Trade Summary
Expression: Long 5Y vs short 2Y & 10Y Treasuries (2s5s10s fly).
Direction: Expect belly to richen.
Horizon: 1â€“3 months tactical, with optional extension depending on Fed cycle.
2. Rationale
The belly is historically cheap vs wings: the 2s5s10s fly trades ~12bp vs a 5-year median of 6bp.
Market has overpriced front-end cuts while underestimating demand for intermediate duration as easing cycle progresses.
Treasury supply dynamics: refunding announcements indicate heavy issuance in 10s, less in 5s â†’ supportive for belly.
Investor flows: Liability-driven and foreign real money accounts tend to prefer the 5Y sector in early cutting cycles.
3. Catalysts
Fed meetings (Sep, Nov): market reprices Fed path depending on inflation persistence.
Treasury refunding (Q4): expected concentration in 10s issuance.
Macro data: softer ISM and core CPI would benefit belly demand.
Positioning: CFTC data shows large speculative longs in 2Y and 10Y, but belly under-owned.
4. Cyclical Regime / Scenario Analysis
Base case (soft landing / gradual easing): 2s cuts priced, belly demand rises, fly normalizes tighter â†’ trade gains.
Upside risk (hard landing): 2s collapse more aggressively, belly doesnâ€™t keep pace â†’ trade loses.
Alternative (reacceleration / sticky inflation): 10s cheapen further on term premia, but 5s still supported vs 2s.
5. Carry & Roll Dynamics
Carry: modestly positiveâ€”belly accrues PnL as 5s roll into a richer curve segment.
Roll-down: supportive over 1â€“2 months if curve remains stable.
Neutral PnL drift: trade has positive carry vs flat to small negative in comparable curve expressions.
6. Valuation Metrics
Current fly ~12bp vs 5-year median ~6bp.
1.3Ïƒ cheap relative to history.
Regression vs OIS-implied forwards suggests belly ~8bp too cheap.
Cross-market check: EUR 2s5s10s already normalized; US lagging.
7. Risk Management
Stop-loss: Cut if fly widens beyond 15bp (thesis invalidated).
Take-profit: Target ~7bp (1Ïƒ richening).
Sizing: Risk budget ~10bp move, use ~15â€“20% of max curve RV allocation.
8. Implementation & Practicalities
Instrument choice: CME futures (TU, FV, TY) â†’ clean expression, good liquidity.
Alternative: Swap curve expression via 2s5s10s OIS fly (less affected by Treasury supply, more policy-pure).
Margin/funding: Futures more balance-sheet efficient vs swaps.
9. Monitoring & Reassessment Triggers
Fed pricing: Watch front-end OIS shifts >15bp.
Auction outcomes: 5Y vs 10Y bid-to-cover ratios.
Macro data: ISM, CPI, payrolls.
Timeline: Reassess after Nov FOMC if thesis hasnâ€™t played out.
ðŸ“Œ Bottom Line: The US 2s5s10s fly is historically cheap, carry-positive, and supported by issuance patterns and cyclical regime. Base case of gradual easing should see belly demand normalize, offering 5â€“6bp of tightening potential.
